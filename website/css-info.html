    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used for stylising or otherwise flavouring a website to make it look more visually appealing, or to arrange elements on a page.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>CSS works by sorting all of the elements in a HTML file and reorganising them, according to the rules established in the page's linked CSS file, or the CSS within the page itself. There are three ways to use CSS - Inline, Internal and External.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
    <p>Inline CSS is the most simple form of CSS. This is used to stylise individual elements of a page, such as for a specific heading or a certain paragraph. With Inline CSS, the CSS code is implemented into the tag of the element being modified.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>The second way to use CSS is with Internal CSS. Internal CSS is still within the main CSS file, but instead of being in each element, all Internal CSS is done from within the Head section of a HTML file. Here, individual elements are selected and styled.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>External CSS</h2>
    <p>The third, and best way to use CSS is with External stylesheets. Here, a separate CSS file is created, then linked with a HTML file. In this CSS file, individual elements can be selected and styled, just like with Internal CSS. However, the benefit to External CSS is that it can be used by multiple HTML files at once. </p>
